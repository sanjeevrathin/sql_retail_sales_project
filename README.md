Project Overview

Project Title: Retail Sales Analysis

Level: Beginner

Database: sql_project

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

Objectives Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data. Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset. Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data. Project Structure

  1)  Database Setup Database Creation: The project starts by creating a database named p1_retail_db. Table Creation: A table named retail_sales is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.
```sql
create database sql_project ;
use sql_project;
--inserted the values
create table Retail_Sales
             (
                 transactions_id int primary key,
                 sale_date date,
                 sale_time time,
                 customer_id int,
                 gender varchar(15),
                 age int,
                 category varchar(15),
                 quantity int,
                 price_per_unit	float,
                 cogs float, 
                 total_sale float
              );   

              select 
                count(*)
              from Retail_Sales;
```
   2) Data Exploration & Cleaning Record Count: Determine the total number of records in the dataset. Customer Count: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset. Category Count: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset. Null Value Check: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.
```sql
select * from Retail_Sales
where transactions_id is null or sale_date is null or gender is null or age is null or category is null
or quantity is null or price_per_unit is null or cogs is null or total_Sale is null 

  select 
       count(*)
  from Retail_Sales;

delete from Retail_Sales
where transactions_id is null or sale_date is null or gender is null or age is null or category is null
or quantity is null or price_per_unit is null or cogs is null or total_Sale is null 

-- Data Exploration
-- how many sales we have 
select count(*) as total_sale from Retail_Sales

-- how many unique customer we have 
select count(distinct customer_id) as total_sale from Retail_Sales

select distinct category  from Retail_Sales
```

   3) Data Analysis & Findings The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

   1) Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:
```sql
select * 
from retail_sales
where sale_date='2022-11-05'
```
    2) Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:
```sql
 select *
 from retail_sales
 where category="clothing"
 and quantity>2 
 and sale_date between'2022-11-01' and '2022-11-30'
```
   3) Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.:
```sql
select category,
sum(total_sale) as total_Sales,
count(*)as total_orders
from Retail_Sales
group by category
```
   4) Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.:
```sql
select round(avg(age),2) as avg_age
from Retail_Sales
where category='beauty'
```
   5) Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:
```sql
select transactions_id
from Retail_Sales
where total_sale > 1000
```
   6) Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:
```sql
 select gender,category,count(transactions_id) as tot_no_of_trans
 from retail_sales
 group by gender,category
 order by gender,category
```
   7) Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:
```sql
with monthly_sales as (select extract(year from sale_date)as year,
extract(month from sale_date)as month,
avg(total_sale)as avg_sales
from retail_sales
group by extract(year from sale_date),extract(month from sale_date))
select * from(select *,
dense_rank() over(partition by year order by avg_sales desc) as rank_num
from monthly_sales) as tab
where rank_num=1
 with monthly_sales as (select
 extract(year from sale_date)as year,
 extract(month from sale_date)as month,
 avg(total_sale)as avg_sales
 from retail_sales
 group by extract(year from sale_date),extract(month from sale_date))
 
 select * from (select *,dense_rank() over (partition by year order by avg_sales desc)as rank_num
 from monthly_sales)as tab1
 where rank_num=1
```
   8) Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
 select customer_id,max(total_sale) as high from retail_sales
 group by customer_id
 order by high desc limit 5
```
   9) Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.:
```sql
select category,count(distinct customer_id) as uniquee
from retail_sales
group by category
```
   10) Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17):
```sql
select 
case 
when extract(hour from sale_time) < 12 then'Morning'
when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17  then'Afternoon'
else 'Evening'
end as shift,
count(*)as number_of_orders
from retail_sales
group by
case when extract(hour from sale_time) < 12 then'Morning'
when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17  then'Afternoon'
else 'Evening'
end
```
Findings Customer Demographics: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty. High-Value Transactions: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases. Sales Trends: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons. Customer Insights: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories. Reports Sales Summary: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance. Trend Analysis: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts. Customer Insights: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category. Conclusion This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
